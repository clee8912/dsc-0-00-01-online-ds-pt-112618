# Welcome

Welcome to Learn! Over the next 800-1000 hours you will learn everything you need to know to get started as a professional Data Scientist! Before you get started, just a few thoughts about to learn best using learn.co. It's going to be harder, and more rewarding than any other learning experience you've ever had, we promise. Let's learn together.

## Learning How To Learn

The most common misconception we get when people start this course is that we're teaching you programming, math, modeling and visualization. Don't get me wrong, we are going to teach you those things, but that's actually not the most important set of things you're going to learn.

Over your career as a professional data scientist you're going to end up programming in languages and using modeling techniques that haven't even been invented yet. The most important thing we're going to teach you is how to learn. While covering topics like Python, Statistics and Regression, we'll work with you to build the skills required to read and understand error messages and to google for answers so once you get a job as a data scientist, when you have to learn a new language, library or model, you'll know just how to go about doing so. We'll also teach you your first set of tools so that you can contribute immediately using them as a professional data scientist.
